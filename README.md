# Job Search Portal
 Here's a template you can use for your job search portal project built on React Native and Rapid API:

This is a job search portal application built using React Native and powered by the Rapid API. It provides a user-friendly interface for job seekers to search for job listings, view job details, and find their dream job easily.

## Features

- **Home Screen**: The Home screen is the landing page of the application, providing users with an overview of available job categories and featured job listings.

- **Job Details Screen**: Users can click on a specific job listing to view detailed information about the job, including the job description, requirements, and application details.

- **Search Screen**: The Search screen allows users to search for jobs based on keywords, location, and other filters. It provides a customized search experience to find the most relevant job listings.
